Install Nodejs from here: http://nodejs.org/

Then run this bad boy:
`npm install -g imageoptim-cli`

Then get the source code from here: https://github.com/electric/optomize.git

Then run the opto-mizer by doing...

`sudo node optomizer.js /path/to/images/folder`

Any image that is writable which is added to that folder should then be opto-mized automatically.
