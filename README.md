# Optomize

This is pretty barebones and pretty simplistic at this stage. It also has a bunch of dependencies.

## Dependencies

- Mac OS
- NodeJS: http://nodejs.org/
- ImageOptim: http://imageoptim.com/

## Installation

If you have git installed, you can clone this repo:

`git clone https://github.com/electric/optomize.git`

Then you can install optomize globally by `cd`ing into the repo directory and running:

`sudo npm install -g`

Once installed, you can watch a folder by doing:

`optomize watch /path/to/images/folder`

Any image that is writable which is added to that folder should then be opto-mized automatically.
