Install Nodejs from here: http://nodejs.org/

Then get the source code from here: https://github.com/electric/optomize.git

Install optomize globally by running
`sudo npm install -g`

Once installed, you can watch a folder by doing
`optomize watch /path/to/images/folder`

Any image that is writable which is added to that folder should then be opto-mized automatically.
